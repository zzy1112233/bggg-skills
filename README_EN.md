# bggg-skills

[中文](./README.md) | English

`bggg-skills` is an open-source collection of Codex Skills from BGGG.

Each skill lives in its own top-level directory and can be copied or symlinked into `~/.codex/skills/`. More reusable BGGG workflows, tool wrappers, and creative capabilities will be added here over time.

## Skills

- [`bggg-creator-image2psd`](./bggg-creator-image2psd): turn one or more images into layered PSD files, with Codex/imagegen-assisted workflows, full-canvas PNG layer export, color splitting, white-background removal, and a pure-Python PSD writer.

## Install

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binggandata/bggg-skills.git
cd bggg-skills
```

Copy a skill into Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R bggg-creator-image2psd ~/.codex/skills/
```

Or symlink it while developing:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/bggg-creator-image2psd" ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2psd
```

If the skill has `scripts/requirements.txt`, install its dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2psd/scripts/requirements.txt
```

## Repository Layout

```text
bggg-skills/
├── README.md
├── README_EN.md

    ├── README_EN.md
    ├── scripts/
    ├── references/
    ├── assets/
    ├── evals/
    └── projects/
```

`projects/` is the local runtime output directory for each skill. The open-source repo keeps only `.gitkeep` there and ignores generated images, PSDs, zips, and process files.

Notes:

- `SKILL.md` is for Codex triggering and execution.
- `README.md` is the main Chinese user-facing README.
- `README_EN.md` is the English README.
- `scripts/` contains deterministic scripts.
- `references/` contains optional reference material.
- `projects/` contains local runtime outputs and should not be committed.
