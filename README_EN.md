# bggg-skills

[中文](./README.md) | English

`bggg-skills` is an open-source collection of Codex Skills from BGGG.

Each skill lives in its own top-level directory and can be copied or symlinked into `~/.codex/skills/`. More reusable BGGG workflows, tool wrappers, and creative capabilities will be added here over time.

## Skills

- [`bggg-creator-image2psd`](./bggg-creator-image2psd): turn one or more images into layered PSD files, with Codex/imagegen-assisted workflows, full-canvas PNG layer export, color splitting, white-background removal, and a pure-Python PSD writer.
- [`bggg-creator-image2ppt`](./bggg-creator-image2ppt): turn images, screenshots, HTML, or SVG designs into editable PPTX files, with Codex/imagegen-assisted component reconstruction, editable text boxes, native shape rebuilding, and HTML/SVG parsing.
- [`bggg-skill-taotie`](./bggg-skill-taotie): a skill evolution engine that compares, analyzes, and absorbs useful patterns from one skill into another.

## Install

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/binggandata/bggg-skills.git
cd bggg-skills
```

Copy a skill into Codex:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R bggg-creator-image2psd ~/.codex/skills/
cp -R bggg-creator-image2ppt ~/.codex/skills/
```

Or symlink it while developing:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/bggg-creator-image2psd" ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2psd
ln -s "$PWD/bggg-creator-image2ppt" ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2ppt
```

If the skill has `scripts/requirements.txt`, install its dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2psd/scripts/requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -r ~/.codex/skills/bggg-creator-image2ppt/scripts/requirements.txt
```

`projects/` is the local runtime output directory for each skill. The open-source repo keeps only `.gitkeep` there and ignores generated images, PSDs, zips, and process files.
